## Introduction

Owners of Caravans, Chalet's, Holiday homes hire their accomodations to others whilst not in use to provide extra income, contributing to the upkeep cost of their property. In this instance, my friend Ben Kennedy owns a Caravan in Isle of Wight, United Kingdom advertising over [Air BnB](#air-bnb) and [DirectHolidayHomes](#directholidayhomes) but continuously checking between sites on bookings and making notes for task to be completed, i.e request for payment, send welcome package e-mail.

As part of my 5 course, level 5 Diploma degree with CodeInstitute, I intend to use my fourth project as an example of a solution for owners and hiring systems and holiday makers. 
My aim is for users to view at ease a calendar with days and their status, either booked and not available, Requested by others and not available, or Free for request. Then forwarding onto a different page for a booking request.

Owners of the holiday home will have the ability to accept or refuse the requested holidays, also store notes for admin use only regarding users.
Users will have the ability to check availability of weeks available, History of visits, adding general feedback to be displayed on the main page and personal notes on previous visits i.e specific stores, attractions.

****
## Approach

Looking at the project scope, users expect a simple and easy to use interface to:

1. Find information (Location, Availability)

1. Make a Booking or Cancellation

1. Log in to find account information.

To get a good understanding of the flow of information, I will first look over multiple websites offering overnight stay, alternative days and rental of accomodation.

Also conduct a Q&A Session with the owner of mentioned caravan to ensure my envisaged and expected information overlaps or includes all relevant information. This session is also used to expand my selection of informaton for what may be helpful at a later stage.
